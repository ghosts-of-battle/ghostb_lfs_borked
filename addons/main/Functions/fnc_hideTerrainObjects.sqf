/*
Function: EFUNC(main,hideTerrainObjects)

Description:
    Hides terrain objects, similar to that of 3DEN's ModuleHideTerrain_F.
    To avoid the issue of exploding buildings re-appearing, we set their damage
    handling to disabled.

Parameters:
    _pos - Position around which we want to hide terrain objects
    _radius - Radius around given position in which to hide terrain objects
    _excludes - Objects to exclude from being hidden
    _types - The types of terrain objects to hide, defaults to ["BUILDINGS", "WALLS", "VEGETATION", "MISC"]

Return Values:
    Array containing the objects that were hidden

Examples:
    Nothing to see here
